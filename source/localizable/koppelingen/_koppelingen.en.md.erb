Through our HR importer, we can import your data from other source systems, such as Beaufort, People Soft, SAP and many other HR systems.

We treat our HR importer as one of our products, which ensures that you will always have the right version of the importer that fits with the correct version of CAPP. What is more, Defacto has established an integration with numerous systems:

## Verpleegkundigen &amp; Verzorgend Nederland (V&amp;VN), the Dutch professional Union for nurses

With V&amp;VN the accredited e-learning courses that your employees take in CAPP are automatically registered within CPD-online. This ensures that you or your employees don’t have to carry out administrative tasks twice.

## Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI)

All e-learning content that supports LTI integration and is hosted somewhere else can be viewed in CAPP. As a result, organisations are no longer dependent on just one supplier and can decide from where to get e-learning content. In this way the content from an external supplier can be viewed in CAPP and the generated results can be displayed in the CAPP-environment.

## Medisch Onderwijs (MO), a platform for medical E-learning applications

Medischonderwijs.nl is intended for the distribution of medical computer based training. A large number of universities and other educational institutes collaborate through ‘Medisch Onderwijs’. Modules that are registered in ‘Medisch Onderwijs’ can also directly be accessed in CAPP. Naturally, the results will be fed back into both systems.

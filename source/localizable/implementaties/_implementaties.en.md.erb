Through experience we have learned that one of the most important aspects of digital learning strategy is directly linked to the implementation process. This prompted Defacto develop its own implementation method. It helps our project managers and consultants safeguard the strategy and execution in partnership with your management team.

A thorough implementation project determines the success of the launch and deployment of our software. It isn’t really all that complex, but when moving to another building you also have to furnish your new home. In our case, instead of furniture, we help you set up the software together. It’s not complicated, we will guide you through the process smoothly.

- We will co-ordinate with your IT-department
- If desired, we will integrate with your HR-system so you'll have access to the most recent information
- We will help you create a digital training catalogue
- We will provide training for your users
- We can also help you with the setting up of annual interviews, the Quality Portfolio or other HR-related activities
- We will assist you with introducing the system into your organisation where needed

Larger organisations should establish a steering group consisting of inbound management and our experienced consultants to achieve the most efficient implementation of the software.

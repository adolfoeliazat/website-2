__The definition: Modern Learner — a person who likes learning what he wants and when he wants. Or one who’s learning needs or habits are changed by their distracting environments.__ 

__Features__: overwhelmed, distracted, impatient.

__In the need of__: personalized, interactive, fun, universal access and concentrated knowledge.

Now, we have covered all the important terms we can get more in depth about why. How modern learners came into being, how to help them and how can modern learners help you?

__Dear modern learner,__

First of all, why are you like this? Because you are reading this blogpost during your work, because your phone has a pushed notification every 2 minutes about what is happening on Facebook, Twitter or LinkedIn, because you are distracted by almost everything that surrounds you! Second of all, you need everything here and now, not in 3 days, but now. Probably your modern working environments led you to understanding that the knowledge should be very easy to reach, find and share.

But what do you get in reality? Your employer has very high expectations for you to stay in the ‘Know everything’ zone and yet he often doesn’t provide you with the instant access to all of the knowledge that is contained within the organization you are working. Actually it doesn’t sounds fair neither for you nor for your employer because both of you want to end up in the win-win situation. A situation where you gain the knowledge that helps you to accomplish your tasks fast and effectively.

__Dear Employer__,

How can you enhance the learning potential of your employees? Just give them knowledge and games, let your employees learn whenever they can. First of all, you have to understand the benefits of personalised informal way of learning. 

* Creating informal learning situations can be less costly and more time efficient given all of the social media technologies and electronic devices we have today.

* Learning informally can be more personal and less intimidating for some people.

* Subject-matter experts may be more willing to share their knowledge with others this way.

* Since learning this way happens more naturally during the flow of someone’s work day, employees may be less likely to resist learning new things.

Second of all, make learning more playful! The engagement of your employees will sky rocket. Quick facts about gamification: 

* Gamification is the use of game mechanics to drive engagement in non-game business scenarios and to change behavior of your employees.

* Many types of games include game mechanics such as points, challenges, leaderboards, rules and incentives that make game-play enjoyable.

* Gamification applies these to motivate the audience to higher and more meaningful levels of engagement.

* Humans are “hard-wired” to enjoy games and have a natural tendency to interact more deeply in activities that are framed in a game construct.

Considering all of these facts, try to unleash the power of modern learner, encourage your employees to exchange their knowledge in an informal way and it will make your business more successful.

We are looking for a developer to join our team and become our colleague. Since June 2017 we have been working on a new application in Elixir in combination with Phoenix. This new application has been built in-house and from scratch.

You preferably have experience with (these are not requirements!):

- The Phoenix Framework
- Test-driven development
- Git (we work with a feature branch / pull request workflow)

Within our workflow, code review and pair programming play an important role, so it is preferable if you already have experience with that. We are looking for someone who gets things done, both in a team and individually.

## What do we offer

- An engaging work atmosphere in a great team
- A competitive salary
- Wide range of training opportunities and budget
- Space and opportunity for your own initiative
- A Bring Your Own Device and lunch arrangement
- An environment that stimulates learning and knowledge sharing

          Give your employees information exactly when they need it. Assign QR codes that link directly to work instructions or protocols to devices or other physical objects (try it for yourself by scanning the adjacent QR code and see how fast it works).

          Use the Shared Spaces functionality to make information available without having to log on to the platform.

          This ensures that every user receives the information required for optimal performance exactly when they need it, in other words: just in time.

          It is impossible to predict exactly which expertise will be required within an organisation. A lack of knowledge is often discovered (too) late because the need for this expertise is hidden. CAPP Agile Learning solves this problem by starting a dialogue with the users.

          Our Question and Answer functionality allows employees to ask the organisation questions when they lack or cannot locate certain information. Help your staff on their way by providing an immediate answer and use their input to create extra content.
